They are generally 1 cm or smallerin size. They may be larger than 1 cm and characterized as normal when fat replacement is pronounced. They frequently occur in the lateral and usually upper portions of the breast closer to theaxilla, although they may occur anywhere in the breast. They usually are seen adjacent to a vein,because the lymphatic drainage of the breast parallels the venous drainage.\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG US."
