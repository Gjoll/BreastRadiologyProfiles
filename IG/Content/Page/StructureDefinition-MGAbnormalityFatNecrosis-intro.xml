  <u style="font-size:large">Mammography Fat Necrosis Definition</u>
</p>
<p>
688
Fat necrosis is a benign (not cancer) condition and
does not increase risk of
developing breast cancer.
It can occur anywhere in the breast and can affect
women of any age.
Men can also get fat necrosis, but this is very rare.
Sometimes a lump can form if an area of the fatty
breast tissue is damaged.
This is called fat necrosis (necrosis is a medical
term used to describe damaged
or dead tissue).
Damage to the fatty tissue can occur following a
breast biopsy, radiotherapy to the
breast or any breast surgery.
The fatty breast tissue can  also be damaged by a
bruise or injury to the breast.
Sometimes it develops without any trauma and many
women with it don't remember any
specific injury.
