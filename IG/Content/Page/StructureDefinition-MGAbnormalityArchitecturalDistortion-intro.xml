  <u style="font-size:large">Mammography Architectural Distortion Definition</u>
</p>
<p>
642
Many breast masses are found within the zone of fibroglandular
tissue or at a fat-fibroglandular
junction.
If the mass blurs a tissue plane between fat and
fibroglandular tissue or if the
mass produces distortion of the ducts, these findings
may be termed architectural distortion.

  <u style="font-size:large;">ACR Mammography Architectural Distortion Definition</u>
</p>
<p>
The parenchyma is distorted with no definite mass visible. For mammography, this includes thin
straight lines or spiculations radiating from a point, and focal retraction, distortion or straightening
at the anterior or posterior edge of the parenchyma. Architectural distortion may also be associ-
ated with a mass, asymmetry, or calcifications. In the absence of appropriate history of trauma or
surgery, architectural distortion is suspicious for malignancy or radial scar, and tissue diagnosis is
appropriate.
As an ASSOCIATED FEATURE, architectural distortion may be used in conjunction with another
finding to indicate that the parenchyma is distorted or retracted adjacent to the FINDING
