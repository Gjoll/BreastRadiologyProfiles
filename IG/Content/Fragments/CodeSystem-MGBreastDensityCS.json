When this occurs, it may be helpful to describe the location(s)of the denser tissue in a second sentence, so that the referring clinician is aware thatthese are the areas in which small noncalcified lesions may be obscured. Suggestedwordings for the second sentence include:\"The dense tissue is located anteriorly in both breasts, and the posterior portionsare mostly fatty.\"\"Primarily dense tissue is located in the upper outer quadrants of both breasts;scattered areas of fibroglandular tissue are present in the remainder of the breasts.\"\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG."

However, it has sincebeen demonstrated in clinical practice that there has been essentially no changein this historical distribution across density categories.\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG."
