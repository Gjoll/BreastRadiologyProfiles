The other 3 types of\nasymmetry, although visible on more than 1 projection, have concave-outward borders and usu-\nally are seen to be interspersed with fat, whereas a radiodense mass displays completely or partially\nconvex-outward borders and appears to be denser in the center than at the periphery.\n-- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013",
