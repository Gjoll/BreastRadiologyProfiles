      "definition": "[Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013]\r\nThese are circumscribed masses that are reniform and have hilar fat. They are generally 1 cm or smallerin size. They may be larger than 1 cm and characterized as normal when fat replacement is pro-nounced. They frequently occur in the lateral and usually upper portions of the breast closer to theaxilla, although they may occur anywhere in the breast. They usually are seen adjacent to a vein,because the lymphatic drainage of the breast parallels the venous drainage."
