They are generally 1 cm or smaller\nin size. They may be larger than 1 cm and characterized as normal when fat replacement is pro-\nnounced. They frequently occur in the lateral and usually upper portions of the breast closer to the\naxilla, although they may occur anywhere in the breast. They usually are seen adjacent to a vein,\nbecause the lymphatic drainage of the breast parallels the venous drainage.\n-- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013 \n*** TODO Items ***** should this be a leaf node (how about shape, density, location, etc).",
