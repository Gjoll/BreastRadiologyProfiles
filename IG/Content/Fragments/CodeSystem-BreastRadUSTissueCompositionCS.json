Shadowing may occur at the interfaces of fat\r\nlobules and parenchyma. This pattern occurs in younger breasts and those with heterogeneously\r\ndense parenchyma depicted mammographically. Whether and how this pattern affects the sensitivity\r\nof sonography merits study, but technical maneuvers may help resolve interpretive dilemmas\r\nthat occasionally result in unnecessary biopsy.\r\n    -- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013"
