  "description": "BiRads Assessment Category Observation\n\nBI-RADS® assessments are divided into incomplete (category 0) and final assessment categories\n(categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). An incomplete mammography assessment, usually rendered at batch-\nread screening mammography, requires further evaluation with additional mammographic views,\nultrasound, and/or comparison mammography examination(s). If the additional evaluation involves\nonly comparison with previous mammography examination(s) that then leads to a final assessment,\nthe incomplete screening assessment is replaced by this final assessment. If the additional evalu-\nation includes a diagnostic imaging examination, a final assessment is rendered for the diagnostic\nexamination, but the screening mammography examination remains assessed as category 0.\n-- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013 \n*** TODO Items ***** Should each mass/calcification observation have its own optional/required BiRad observation or just the Left/Right/Combined sections?\n** How is this different from CommonObservedState",
