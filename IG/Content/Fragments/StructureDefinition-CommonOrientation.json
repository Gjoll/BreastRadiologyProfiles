Obliquely situated masses may follow a radial pattern, and their long axes will help determine\nclassification as parallel or not parallel. Parallel or \"wider-than-tall\" orientation is a property of most\nbenign masses, notably fibroadenomas; however, many carcinomas have this orientation as well.\nOrientation alone should not be used as an isolated feature in assessing a mass for its likelihood of\nmalignancy.\n-- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013",
