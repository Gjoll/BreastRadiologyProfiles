For mammography, this includes thin\nstraight lines or spiculations radiating from a point, and focal retraction, distortion or straightening\nat the anterior or posterior edge of the parenchyma. Architectural distortion may also be associ-\nated with a mass, asymmetry, or calcifications. In the absence of appropriate history of trauma or\nsurgery, architectural distortion is suspicious for malignancy or radial scar, and tissue diagnosis is\nappropriate.\nAs an ASSOCIATED FEATURE, architectural distortion may be used in conjunction with another\nfinding to indicate that the parenchyma is distorted or retracted adjacent to the FINDING\n-- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013",
