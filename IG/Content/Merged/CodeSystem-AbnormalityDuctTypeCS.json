      "definition": "[PR] Duct dilated ATLAS solitary dilated duct\r\nThe mammographic finding of solitary dilated duct is rare and poorly understood. \r\r\nThere are anecdotal reports of solitary dilated duct as the only mammographic finding \r\r\nof underlying malignancy, indicating its potential importance in the early detection \r\r\nof breast cancer. \r\r\nHowever, some investigators have estimated that the finding of solitary dilated duct \r\r\nhas a very low risk of malignancy, supporting its assessment as a benign (BI-RADS \r\r\ncategory 2) or probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) lesion. \r\r\nSolitary dilated duct also has been reported to coexist with more suspicious mammographic \r\r\nfindings, but in such cases the associated mass, grouped microcalcifications, architectural \r\r\ndistortion, or developing asymmetry would itself have a sufficiently high likelihood \r\r\nof malignancy to prompt a suspicious (BI-RADS category 4) assessment.\r\r\nSolitary dilated duct is described and illustrated in the current edition of the \r\r\nBI-RADS atlas as the first of four mammographic findings classified as \"special cases\" \r\r\n. \r\r\nThe accompanying text states that \"if unassociated with other suspicious clinical \r\r\nor mammographic findings, it is usually of minor clinical significance\". \r\r\nInsofar as this statement is made under the imprimatur of the widely read BI-RADS \r\r\natlas, it is likely to influence those practicing radiologists without much, if any, \r\r\npersonal experience who encounter the rare finding of solitary dilated duct. \r\r\nHowever, to our knowledge, to date there is no large clinical series indicating the \r\r\npositive predictive value for malignancy of solitary dilated duct. \r\r\nThe goal of this largescale study is to report the clinical and pathologic outcomes \r\r\nfor the isolated finding of solitary dilated duct identified at screening or diagnostic \r\r\nmammography. \r\r\n-- https://www.ajronline.org/doi/full/10.2214/AJR.09.2944\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG US."
